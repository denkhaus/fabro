//! The projector: the view pass that folds a Petri run's committed records
//! into its stored projection, and the wake-up that drives it.
//!
//! # Commit rule
//!
//! Records first. Petri's append (the worker's append endpoint, then
//! `SqliteRunStore::append`) and a platform record's insert are the
//! durability boundaries, and both return before any view work. A view pass
//! then reads what is committed, folds the items past the positions the
//! view last committed, and writes the derived rows in one later
//! transaction together with the new positions: the last event consumed per
//! Petri log, the last platform record consumed, and the delivery sequence
//! (`stream_seq`) it assigned to each item. The view therefore trails a
//! committed record and never leads one. No projection state of Petri's is
//! checkpointed: a pass derives the events past the held positions from
//! the records alone, and every stored view equals a full replay
//! (`replay_run`) of the records it holds.
//!
//! A pass that finds new platform records committed between its read and
//! its write leaves the view alone and runs again, so the `runs` row never
//! moves backwards behind a concurrent lifecycle write.
//!
//! # The live run's cache
//!
//! A pass keeps in memory, per live run, Petri's replay of the run (a
//! `RunReplay`: the coordinator state, each execution's engine state, the
//! projection) and the view as the pass last committed it, so the next
//! pass reads and folds only the records past the ones the view holds and
//! costs the new records, not the run's length. The cache is never a
//! source of facts and never checkpointed: it is dropped when the run
//! records its finish, after ten idle minutes, when the stored view moves
//! under it, when the run is deleted, and with the process, and the first
//! pass after that rebuilds it by a full replay. A pass that commits
//! nothing (a platform record landed under it, or it failed before its
//! view transaction) keeps the events it derived for the next pass, so
//! nothing is derived twice or lost.
//!
//! # Where it runs
//!
//! In the server. [`Projector::signal`] schedules a pass for a run: the
//! server calls it after each committed worker append and, through the run
//! summary store's hook, after each committed platform record; signals
//! that arrive while a pass runs coalesce into one more pass. A signal is a
//! wake-up only, never a source of facts: a signal that is lost costs
//! nothing but latency, because the next signal or the startup pass
//! ([`Projector::startup_pass`]) folds everything the view still trails.
//!
//! # A torn tail
//!
//! A record the store holds that Petri cannot read (a gap in a log, a line
//! that does not decode) fails the replay. The pass then advances no Petri
//! position, folds only the platform records, and reports the run's record
//! as incomplete with the replay's error; `inspect_run` decides
//! completeness once the run has recorded its finish.
