//! A run's sandboxes deleted through Petri's lease ledger.
//!
//! Petri records every sandbox a run creates as a lease: the provider, the
//! provider's id for the resource, and the fingerprint of the backend it
//! lives on. When Fabro deletes a run, its sandboxes go the way `petri
//! sandbox prune` deletes them, over the store the run's records live in,
//! rather than through a provider call of Fabro's own: Petri opens the run
//! for writing, so a live worker that still holds the lease refuses the
//! delete; it checks each lease's fingerprint against the plugin it
//! launches, so a changed daemon or account is a problem to report, never
//! a delete on another backend; it writes the delete intent before the
//! provider call and the tombstone after, beside the run's other records;
//! and each provider removes its sandbox's managed workspace, a host
//! workspace under the run directory included.
//!
//! The runtime a prune runs on is the run's as [`engine`](crate::engine)
//! assembles it, reduced to what a prune reads: the store, the run key, the
//! run directory (where Petri's host registry and action-host markers are)
//! and the sandbox backend. No step registry, frontend or model client
//! takes part.
